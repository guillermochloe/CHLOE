<section id="myself">
    <h1>Myself/About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Jazelle Chloe C. Guillermo, a 19-year-old first-year Computer Science student at Cavite State University - Imus Campus. I was born on November 19, 2005, making me a proud Scorpio! While I'm an introvert, I feel comfortable and playful when I'm with my friends and family. <br> 
        I chose to pursue Computer Science because I was inspired by my dad, who is a Network Engineer/IT professional. His dedication to his work sparked my interest in technology. Another turning point for me was receiving the Best in Computer System Servicing and Best in Science awards during my Grade 10 moving-up ceremony. I took it as a sign that this path was meant for me. <br> 

        Beyond academics, I am a creative and curious individual who loves exploring astronomy, especially the moon, which fascinates me. I enjoy music, movies, and reading, as they allow me to escape and expand my imagination. My hobbies include crocheting and playing the ukulele, which let me express my creativity. <br> 

        I also enjoy staying active with sports like basketball, biking, and fishing. In addition, I'm a huge fan of K-pop and P-pop, with my favorite groups being ENHYPEN, SEVENTEEN, BINI, and IZNA. Their music has become my safe and comforting space, inspiring me daily. <br> 

        Through this website, I hope to share my journey, including my aspirations, achievements, and the little things that make life meaningful to me. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better!<br>
        Here are some photos that highlight my life so far, capturing the moments & memories that make me who I am.</p>
